Revision history for Perl module PAUSE::Permissions

0.17 2017-05-14 NEILB
    - Two places were doing "return sort @foo", which can behave unpredictably
      depending on the calling context. Thanks to OALDERS, for the PR,
      and his incredible patience in my not merging and releasing a simple fix.
    - Updated the live release test, to reflect changes in 06perms.txt

0.16 2016-02-28 NEILB
    - Switched to using any() from List::Util (as of 1.33) instead of
      from List::MoreUtils, since LU is a core module.

0.15 2016-02-14 NEILB
    - YANICK added a pause-permissions script, which lets you get permissions
      info from the command line. Thanks Yanick!
    - Experimenting with not shipping dist.ini to CPAN. Blame Yanick.
    - Release test was failing because some new modules on CPAN were
      matching.

0.14 2015-04-17 NEILB
    - Added the has_permission_for() method, after discussion with
      ISHIGAKI, following GH#9.

0.13 2015-04-16 NEILB
    - Added the can_upload(USER,MODULE) method, which returns true
      if the specified user has permission to upload the module.
      Ie either the module IS in 06perms.txt and the USER is listed
      against it (c, f, or m). Or it doesn't appear at all, so the USER
      would get first-come (f). Requested by ISHIGAKI in GH#8.

0.12 2015-04-16 NEILB
    - This is the "Ishigaki release", prompted by ISHIGAKI at the QAH.
    - Added 'preload' attribute, which is used in association with the
      module_permissions() method. If you set preload to 1, then all
      permissions data gets loaded into memory the first time you call
      module_permissions() method, and every further call will just get
      the in-memory data. Suggested by ISHIGAKI++.
    - Added cache_path attribute, as distinct from path. The former is
      the local path where the remote source should be cached, after
      transformation (we don't use the raw 06perms.txt, but munge it).
      The 'path' attribute lets you say "hey, just use this file I've already
      got", effectively providing your own cached version, post-transformation.
    - Added max_age attribute: within that time we don't even bother checking
      whether the remote source has changed. Uses Time::Duration::Parse to
      pause the max_age time specification.

0.11 2015-01-25 NEILB
    - Changed File::Slurp to Path::Tiny. Thanks to MartinMcGrath.
    - Moved t/04-live-module-iterator.t to be a release-only test,
      xt/release/04-live-module-iterator.t.

0.10 2014-09-01 NEILB
    - Documentation fix: 'filename' was changed to 'path' in 0.05.
      ISHIGAKI++

0.09 2014-04-07 NEILB
    - Documentation now says you should use 0.08 or later,
      to make sure you get the case-insensitive handling of package names.
    - Using croak() but didn't have "use Carp" - thanks to TOKUHIROM

0.08 2014-03-13 NEILB
    - Handle package names case-insenstively, as PAUSE now does.
      Based on two bug reports from RJBS (#1, #2 on github).

0.07 2013-12-06 NEILB
    - Added 'use 5.10.0' to ModuleIterator, as it's using two features
      introduced in 5.10. Thank you CPAN Testers.
    - Added SEE ALSO link to App::PAUSE::CheckPerms

0.06 2013-12-04 NEILB
    - added module_iterator() method on PAUSE::Permissions,
      which returns an iterator that will loop over 06perms.txt
      returning an instance of PAUSE::Permissions::Module each
      time it's called.

0.05 2013-08-26 NEILB
    - switched to Moo
    - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES - simplifying things:
        + merged public 'filename' and private '_path' into 'path'.
          If you pass to the constructor, it's where we'll read from,
          other we'll set it based on File::HomeDir->my_dist_data
        + changed 'uri' to 'url', because that's more accurate
        + dropped the 'cachedir' parameter
      Thanks to DAGOLDEN for the suggestions.
    - Added method entry_iterator() which returns an instance of
      PAUSE::Permissions::EntryIterator. Iterates over the whole file.
    - switched from [GitHub::Meta] to [GithubMeta] in dist.ini

0.04 2012-10-21 NEILB
    - Removed a debugging print statement.

0.03 2012-10-16 NEILB
    - Forgot to include [AutoPrereqs] and other things in dist.ini,
      so prereqs not getting declared :-(
      Thanks to JWRIGHT

0.02 2012-10-15 NEILB
    - ANDK's surname was coming out mangled on the umlaut, so using E<ouml>
    - Various documentation tweaks

0.01 2012-10-14 NEILB
    - initial release to CPAN
